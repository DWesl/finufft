This directory contains simple calling examples from C++ (the .cpp files)
and from C (the .c files).

They are compiled by commands in ../makefile via "make examples".

The suffix "f" which distinguishes simple1d1f.cpp from simple1d1.cpp
indicates single-precision as opposed to double-precision.

The suffix "c" indicates a C (as opposed to C++) demo.

For calling from Fortran, see the demos in ../fortran/examples
