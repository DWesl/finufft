Testing (validation not performance) directory for FINUFFT.

All source codes in here are dual precision (ie, depending on the -DSINGLE
compilation flag presence, they build double or single precision and link
against the appropriate FINUFFT library functions).

check_finufft.sh : validates the NUFFT library for correctness.
results/*.refout : reference outputs that the generated outputs *,out will be compared against.
check?d.sh : used by check_finufft.sh

Possibly obsolete scripts (for developers):
checkallaccs.sh : spreading and NUFFT at all #s of digits, for a single ndims


Also see:
../perftest for performance tests
