This directory contains f77-style Fortran wrappers to the FINUFFT C++ library
and examples that use them. They are deliberately "legacy" fortran, ie f77
plus dynamic allocation, but no later features.

Directory structure:

finufft_f.cpp - the C++ to fortran wrapper layer (goes into libfinufft.a, etc)
examples/ - fortran driver examples
test/     - helper routines for tests that occur in the examples

Please refer to (equivalent forms of) documentation in
  ../docs/fortran.rst                (human-readable text)
  ../finufft-manual.pdf              (PDF)
  https://finufft.readthedocs.io/    (online)

Please (cd ..; make fortran) to build the examples.
