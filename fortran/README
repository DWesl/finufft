This directory contains f77-style Fortran wrappers to the FINUFFT C++ library
and examples that showcase them. They are deliberately "legacy" fortran, ie f77
plus dynamic allocation, and a derived type if you want to change options.

Directory structure:

finufft_f.cpp  - the C++ to fortran wrapper layer (goes into libfinufft.a, etc)
examples/      - fortran driver examples
directft/      - direct summation routines from the CMCL NUFFT package

Also you will need to include ../include/finufft.fh if you want to change opts.

Please refer to (equivalent forms of) documentation in
  ../docs/fortran.rst                (human-readable text)
  ../finufft-manual.pdf              (PDF)
  https://finufft.readthedocs.io/    (online)

Please (cd ..; make fortran) to build and run the examples.
Notes:
 1) the examples/nufft?d_demo from CMCL will request tol=1e-16 and
    FINUFFT will report a warning that it cannot achieve this; it gets
    around 1e-14.
