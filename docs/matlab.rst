Here are the help documentation strings for all MATLAB/octave interfaces.
They only abbreviate the options and error codes.
For full documentation of options see :ref:`opts`.
For a full list of error codes see :ref:`errcodes`.

If you have added the ``matlab`` directory of FINUFFT correctly to your
MATLAB path via something like ``addpath FINUFFT/matlab``, then
``help finufft/matlab`` will give the summary of all commands:

.. literalinclude:: ../matlab/Contents.m

The individual commands have the following help documentation:
                    
.. include:: matlabhelp.raw
