MATLAB/octave interfaces to FINUFFT.

See Contents.m for a list of commands available.
See comments headers in *.m for usage of each command.
See ../docs/matlab.rst for local human-readable help

Notes for maintainers on management of this directory
-----------------------------------------------------

For ease of maintainance we use a single source of truth as much as possible,
thus some files are generated by others.


* MEX interfaces:

From the source finufft.mw, the files finufft.ccp and finufft_plan.m
are auto-generated by MWrap (see ../makefile: make mex). This need not
be run by typical users, since the latter two are part of the git
repo. A recent version of MWrap must be used.
See: https://github.com/zgimbutas/mwrap

The simple interfaces finufft?d?.m are short wrappers to the
finufft_plan.m object methods.


* Documentation:

The source of MATLAB documentation is *.docsrc, which are matlab comment
blocks, plus tokens indicating insertion of repeated text blocks.
Our bash script addmhelp.sh uses *.docsrc write help comment blocks into
the *.m files, using repeated text blocks in:
opts.docbit
tail.docbit

Once *.m contain the updated help comments, one should run:

 - in MATLAB: contentsrpt to generate/update the Contents.m
 - in the shell: ../docs/genmatlabhelp.sh to update .rst web doc source
